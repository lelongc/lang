I want to master the English topic "[Education]" for IELTS 7.0+ and native-like communication.
Please give me a very long and complete list of high-frequency words, expressions, and collocations (chunks) used in this topic.
I want only the list – no definitions, no examples, no explanations.
The output should be:
Bullet points or plain list
Grouped by sub-topic if possible (e.g., school life, higher education, online learning…)
Each line is one phrase or chunk only
Keep going until the output limit is reached. If it stops, I will type “Continue” to get more.
I will use this to memorize all important phrases in this topic.
