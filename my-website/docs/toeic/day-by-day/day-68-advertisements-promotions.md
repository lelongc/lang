## ⚡ 6. Speed Reading Advertisements

### Scanning Priorities:
```
👁️ LOOK FOR FIRST:
1. Price information (most important for decisions)
2. Offer details (discounts, promotions)
3. Time limitations (deadlines, expiration)
4. Contact information (how to respond)
5. Terms and conditions (restrictions)

⚡ AD READING STRATEGY:
• Headline → Offer → Call-to-action → Fine print
• Skip marketing fluff, focus on facts
• Look for numbers (prices, percentages, dates)
• Identify what action is required
```

### Question Approach:
```
🔍 COMMON AD QUESTION TYPES:

PRICE QUESTIONS:
"How much does...?" → Look for specific prices
"What discount...?" → Find percentage or amount off

OFFER QUESTIONS:  
"What is included...?" → Scan benefit lists
"When does offer expire...?" → Find time limits

CONTACT QUESTIONS:
"How can customers...?" → Locate contact methods
"Where is the business...?" → Find address/location

TERMS QUESTIONS:
"What restrictions...?" → Check fine print
"What conditions...?" → Look for limitations
```

---

## 🎯 7. Common Advertisement Traps

### Misleading Information:
```
🪤 WATCH OUT FOR:
• "Up to X% off" (may be maximum, not typical)
• "Starting at $X" (lowest price, may not be available)
• "Compare at $X" (inflated comparison price)
• "Limited time" (may be extended repeatedly)

✅ LOOK FOR CLARITY:
• Specific prices and discounts
• Clear expiration dates
• Exact terms and conditions
• Real customer reviews
```

### Answer Choice Traps:
```
❌ WRONG ANSWER PATTERNS:
• Prices mentioned but not the asked price
• Benefits listed but not the specific benefit asked
• Contact methods given but not the requested method
• Time periods mentioned but not the relevant timeframe

✅ RIGHT ANSWER CHARACTERISTICS:
• Directly answers the specific question
• Uses information explicitly stated in ad
• Matches the exact details requested
• Found in the relevant section of advertisement
