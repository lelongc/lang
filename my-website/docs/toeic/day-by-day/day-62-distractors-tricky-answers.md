## 🎯 6. Part 2 Elimination Techniques

### The 3-Second Rule:
```
1. Listen to question (3 seconds)
2. Identify question type (WHO/WHAT/WHEN/WHERE/WHY/HOW)
3. Predict answer type needed
4. Eliminate answers that don't match

Time allocation:
- Question comprehension: 30%
- Prediction: 20% 
- Answer evaluation: 50%
```

### The Logic Test:
```
Ask yourself:
1. Does this answer the specific question asked?
2. Is this a natural response a person would give?
3. Does this fit the context/situation?
4. Is this too general/vague for the specific question?
```

### The Content vs. Form Test:
```
Content (meaning): What information is provided?
Form (structure): Does it match the question type?

Example:
Q: "Who's your doctor?"
A: "Doctors are important." ← Form matches (about doctors) but Content wrong (doesn't identify specific doctor)
B: "Dr. Martinez at City Hospital." ← Both Form and Content correct
```
