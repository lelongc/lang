## 9. TOEIC Focus: Lỗi Phổ Biến

### Lỗi 1: Dùng Sai Loại Liên Từ

❌ **SAI:**
```
I worked hard, and I failed. (Không hợp lý - "and" chỉ dùng khi cả 2 cùng tích cực)
She was tired, so she didn't work. (Dùng "so" khi nên dùng "because")
Although he studied, he passed. (Dùng "although" khi nên dùng "and" hoặc "so")
```

✅ **ĐÚNG:**
```
I worked hard, but I failed. (Đối lập - "but")
She was tired, so she rested. (Kết quả - "so")
Because he studied, he passed. (Nguyên nhân - "because")
```

---

### Lỗi 2: Dùng Comma Sai Với Subordinating Conjunctions

❌ **SAI:**
```
Although, the task is hard we'll finish. (Sai comma)
I'll attend if, I'm free. (Sai comma)
```

✅ **ĐÚNG:**
```
Although the task is hard, we'll finish. (Comma sau dependent clause ở đầu)
I'll attend if I'm free. (Không cần comma khi dependent clause ở cuối)
```

---

### Lỗi 3: Quên Mệnh Đề Chính

❌ **SAI:**
```
Because I was tired. (Chỉ có dependent clause)
Although the project was difficult. (Không đầy đủ)
```

✅ **ĐÚNG:**
```
Because I was tired, I went home. (Đủ cả 2 mệnh đề)
Although the project was difficult, we finished. (Có cả 2 mệnh đề)
```

---

### Lỗi 4: Dùng Correlative Conjunctions Không Cân Xứng

❌ **SAI:**
```
Both John and also Mary attended. (Sai - "also" không phù hợp)
Neither he or she came. (Sai - "or" phải là "nor")
```

✅ **ĐÚNG:**
```
Both John and Mary attended.
Neither he nor she came.
```

---

### Lỗi 5: Sai Cấu Trúc Với Comma

❌ **SAI:**
```
I worked hard and I succeeded. (Không có comma, cấu trúc Compound phải có comma trước coordinating conj)
We finished, therefore we celebrated. (Sai - "therefore" cần dấu chấm phẩy hoặc period trước nó)
```

✅ **ĐÚNG:**
```
I worked hard, and I succeeded. (Có comma)
We finished; therefore, we celebrated. (Dấu chấm phẩy trước transitional word)
```
