## 1. Định Nghĩa & Tại Sao Quan Trọng

### Mệnh Đề Quan Hệ Là Gì?

**Mệnh đề quan hệ (Relative Clause)** là một **mệnh đề phụ** bổ sung thông tin về một danh từ trong câu chính, bắt đầu bằng **từ quan hệ (relative pronoun)**.

### Ví Dụ

| Câu gốc | Mệnh đề quan hệ | Câu kết hợp |
|---|---|---|
| The person is talented. | He works here. | The person **who works here** is talented. |
| The project is important. | It has many stakeholders. | The project **which has many stakeholders** is important. |
| The manager leads the team. | Her name is Sarah. | The manager **whose name is Sarah** leads the team. |

### Tại Sao Quan Trọng?

1. **TOEIC Part 5:** ~8-10% câu hỏi về mệnh đề quan hệ
2. **Viết formal:** Cần mệnh đề quan hệ để bổ sung thông tin
3. **Từ quan hệ:** Phân biệt who/whom/which/that là quan trọng
4. **Cấu trúc câu:** Giúp tạo câu phức tạp, chuyên nghiệp

---

## 2. Từ Quan Hệ & Cách Dùng

### 2.1. Bảng Tổng Quan Từ Quan Hệ

| Từ quan hệ | Loại | Ví dụ | Ghi chú |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Who** | Người (Subject) | The person **who works** here | Chủ ngữ của mệnh đề quan hệ |
| **Whom** | Người (Object) | The person **whom I met** | Tân ngữ của mệnh đề quan hệ |
| **Whose** | Sở hữu | The manager **whose team** won | Chỉ sở hữu |
| **Which** | Vật (Subject/Object) | The project **which is complex** | Có thể là chủ ngữ hoặc tân ngữ |
| **That** | Người/Vật (Subject/Object) | The project **that we completed** | Rút gọn, thường dùng hơn |
| **Where** | Nơi chốn | The office **where we work** | Chỉ vị trí |
| **When** | Thời gian | The time **when we met** | Chỉ thời gian (ít dùng) |
| **Why** | Lý do | The reason **why we decided** | Chỉ lý do (rất ít dùng) |

---

## 3. Who vs Whom vs Whose

### 3.1. Who (Chủ Ngữ - Subject)

**Dùng khi:** Từ quan hệ là **chủ ngữ** của mệnh đề quan hệ

```
The person [who + verb] ...
```

| Ví dụ |
|---|
| The employee **who works** hard is promoted. (who = chủ ngữ của "works") |
| The manager **who leads** the team is experienced. (who = chủ ngữ của "leads") |
| The person **who called** me yesterday is Sarah. (who = chủ ngữ của "called") |

---

### 3.2. Whom (Tân Ngữ - Object)

**Dùng khi:** Từ quan hệ là **tân ngữ** của mệnh đề quan hệ

```
The person [whom + subject + verb] ...
```

| Ví dụ |
|---|
| The employee **whom** I hired is talented. (whom = tân ngữ của "hired", I là chủ ngữ) |
| The manager **whom** we respect is retiring. (whom = tân ngữ của "respect", we là chủ ngữ) |
| The person **whom** she met is John. (whom = tân ngữ của "met", she là chủ ngữ) |

**Lưu ý:** Trong tiếng Anh nói, "whom" ngày càng ít dùng, nhiều người dùng "who" thay thế, nhưng TOEIC vẫn kiểm tra phân biệt this.

---

### 3.3. Whose (Sở Hữu - Possessive)

**Dùng khi:** Chỉ sở hữu hoặc liên quan sở hữu

```
The person [whose + noun] ...
```

| Ví dụ |
|---|
| The manager **whose team** won first place is celebrated. (whose team = nhóm của người quản lý) |
| The employee **whose idea** was selected is rewarded. (whose idea = ý tưởng của nhân viên) |
| The person **whose name** is Sarah leads the project. (whose name = tên của người đó) |

---

### 3.4. So Sánh: Who vs Whom

| Who | Whom |
|---|---|
| **Chủ ngữ của mệnh đề quan hệ** | **Tân ngữ của mệnh đề quan hệ** |
| The employee **who works** hard | The employee **whom** I hired |
| The person **who called** me | The person **whom** she met |
| **Thay "he" hoặc "she"** | **Thay "him" hoặc "her"** |

**Mẹo nhớ:**
- **Who** = như "he/she" (chủ ngữ)
- **Whom** = như "him/her" (tân ngữ)

```
He works here → The person who works here
I hired him → The person whom I hired
```

---

## 4. Which vs That

### 4.1. Which (Vật - Things/Objects)

**Dùng khi:** Chỉ **vật, công việc, ý tưởng** (không chỉ người)

| Ví dụ |
|---|
| The project **which is complex** requires expertise. |
| The software **which we use** is outdated. |
| The idea **which she proposed** is innovative. |

---

### 4.2. That (Người hoặc Vật)

**Dùng khi:** Chỉ người hoặc vật, **thường dùng hơn "which"** trong mệnh đề hạn định

| Ví dụ |
|---|
| The employee **that works** here is talented. (Có thể thay cho "who") |
| The project **that we completed** is successful. (Có thể thay cho "which") |
| The person **that called** me is Sarah. (Có thể thay cho "who") |

---

### 4.3. So Sánh: Which vs That

| Which | That |
|---|---|
| **Formal, chủ yếu cho vật** | **Phổ biến, cho cả người và vật** |
| The project **which** is complex... | The project **that** is complex... |
| **Thường dùng trong non-restrictive** | **Thường dùng trong restrictive** |
| The project, **which** is complex, needs expertise. | The project **that** we need is complex. |
| **Không thể bỏ được trong non-restrictive** | **Có thể bỏ được trong restrictive** |

**Quy tắc:**
- **Restrictive (hạn định) → Dùng "that" hoặc bỏ entirely**
- **Non-restrictive (không hạn định) → Dùng "which" + Comma**

---

## 5. Mệnh Đề Quan Hệ Hạn Định (Restrictive)

### 5.1. Định Nghĩa Restrictive Clause

**Restrictive Clause** = Mệnh đề **cần thiết**, bỏ không được, **không có comma**

### Ví Dụ Restrictive Clauses

| Ví dụ | Giải thích |
|---|---|
| The employee **who** works hard is promoted. | Ai? Employee who works hard (Cần thiết để xác định) |
| The project **that** we completed is successful. | Nào? Project that we completed (Cần thiết để xác định) |

```

| Ví dụ |
|---|
| The manager **who leads** the team is experienced. |

|---|---|
| Sarah, **who** works here, is talented. | Sarah đã xác định rõ, mệnh đề chỉ bổ sung) |
| The project, **which** is complex, needs expertise. | Project đã xác định, mệnh đề chỉ bổ sung) |

### 6.2. So Sánh: Restrictive vs Non-Restrictive

| Restrictive (Hạn Định) | Non-Restrictive (Không Hạn Định) |
|---|---|
| **Cần thiết để xác định** | **Bổ sung thông tin** |
| The employee **who** works hard is promoted. | Sarah, **who** works hard, is promoted. |
| **Không có comma** | **Có comma** |

---

## 7. Vị Trí Mệnh Đề Quan Hệ & Cấu Trúc Câu

### 7.1. Vị Trí Mệnh Đề Quan Hệ

**Mệnh đề quan hệ** luôn đứng **ngay sau danh từ mà nó bổ sung**

```
[Main Clause] + [Noun] + [Relative Clause] + [Rest of Main Clause]
```

| Ví dụ |
|---|
| The employee **who** works hard is promoted. (Ngay sau "employee") |

**Reduced Clause** = Bỏ relative pronoun + auxiliary verb, để lại participle (V-ing hoặc V-ed)

### 8.2. Khi Nào Rút Gọn?

#### Loại 1: Active Voice + "Who/That" làm Subject

## 9. TOEIC Focus: Lỗi Phổ Biến

### Lỗi 1: Nhầm Who vs Whom

❌ **SAI:**
```
The employee whom works hard is promoted. (Sai - phải là "who" vì là chủ ngữ)
The person who I hired is talented. (Sai - phải là "whom" vì là tân ngữ)
```

✅ **ĐÚNG:**
```
The employee who works hard is promoted. (who = chủ ngữ của "works")
The person whom I hired is talented. (whom = tân ngữ của "hired")
```

---

### Lỗi 2: Nhầm Which vs That

❌ **SAI:**
```
The project that is complex, needs expertise. (Sai - non-restrictive phải dùng "which")
The project which we completed is successful. (Sai - restrictive thường dùng "that")
```

✅ **ĐÚNG:**
```
The project, which is complex, needs expertise. (Non-restrictive = "which")
The project that we completed is successful. (Restrictive = "that")
```

---

### Lỗi 3: Sai Comma Với Relative Clause

❌ **SAI:**
```
The employee, who works hard, is promoted. (Thừa comma - restrictive không cần comma)
Sarah which is talented, leads the team. (Sai - non-restrictive là "who" không "which")
```

✅ **ĐÚNG:**
```
The employee who works hard is promoted. (Restrictive - không comma)
Sarah, who is talented, leads the team. (Non-restrictive - có comma)
```

---

### Lỗi 4: Dùng Relative Pronoun Không Phù Hợp Với Antecedent

❌ **SAI:**
```
The software which he is talented. (Sai - "which" dùng cho vật, nhưng "he" chỉ người)
The person that the project needs. (Sai - "that" không phù hợp)
```

✅ **ĐÚNG:**
```
The software that he uses is outdated. (Vật = "that")
The person who the project needs is experienced. (Người = "who")
```

---

### Lỗi 5: Quên Relative Pronoun

❌ **SAI:**
```
The employee works hard is promoted. (Quên relative pronoun)
The project we completed is successful. (Nếu là restrictive, OK; nhưng nếu muốn rõ ràng)
```

✅ **ĐÚNG:**
```
The employee who works hard is promoted.
The project that we completed is successful.
```
