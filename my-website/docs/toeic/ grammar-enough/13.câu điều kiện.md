## 1. Định Nghĩa & Tại Sao Quan Trọng

### Câu Điều Kiện Là Gì?

**Câu điều kiện (Conditional Sentence)** bao gồm hai phần:
- **If clause (Điều kiện):** Diễn tả giả thuyết hoặc điều kiện
- **Main clause (Kết quả):** Diễn tả hệ quả nếu điều kiện xảy ra

### Ví Dụ

| Loại | Ví dụ | Ý nghĩa |
|---|---|---|
| **Type 0** | **If** you heat water to 100°C, **it boils**. | Sự thật chung, luôn đúng |
| **Type 1** | **If** you study hard, **you will pass**. | Có thể xảy ra trong tương lai |
| **Type 2** | **If** I were you, **I would apply**. | Không thực tế hiện tại (nhưng tôi không phải bạn) |
| **Type 3** | **If** I had studied, **I would have passed**. | Không thực tế quá khứ (nhưng tôi đã không học) |

### Tại Sao Quan Trọng?

1. **TOEIC Part 5:** ~5-7% câu hỏi về câu điều kiện
2. **Giao tiếp:** Diễn tả dự đoán, sự kiện tương lai, và giả thuyết
3. **Viết formal:** Email, báo cáo cần câu điều kiện để trình bày kịch bản

If he was the manager, he would decide. (Sai)
```
