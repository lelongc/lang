## 9. TOEIC Focus: Lỗi Phổ Biến & Mẹo

### Lỗi 1: Sai Present Perfect vs Simple Past

❌ **SAI:**
```
I worked here for 5 years. (Không rõ vẫn làm hay không)
She has completed the project last week. (Sai - không dùng "last week" với Present Perfect)
Did you ever travel to Japan? (Nên dùng Present Perfect)
```

✅ **ĐÚNG:**
```
I have worked here for 5 years. (Vẫn làm)
She completed the project last week. (Xong rồi)
Have you ever traveled to Japan? (Từng đi chưa?)
```

**Mẹo:** 
- **Thời gian cụ thể (last, yesterday, ago)** → Simple Past
- **Thời gian không cụ thể (for, since, just, yet)** → Present Perfect

---

### Lỗi 2: Sai vị trí của "yet" và "already"

❌ **SAI:**
```
Have you finished already the report? (Sai vị trí)
I have already completed the work yet. (Dùng "already" và "yet" cùng lúc)
```

✅ **ĐÚNG:**
```
Have you already finished the report?
I have already completed the work.
Have you finished the work yet?
```

**Mẹo:**
- **already** (đã xong) → Câu khẳng định, đứng giữa "have/has" và động từ
- **yet** (chưa xong) → Câu phủ định hoặc câu hỏi, đứng cuối câu

---

### Lỗi 3: Sai "for" vs "since"

❌ **SAI:**
```
I have worked here for 5 years ago. (Sai - "for" + khoảng thời gian, không "ago")
She has worked since 2020. (Nên thêm "for" hoặc "since the year 2020")
```

✅ **ĐÚNG:**
```
I have worked here for 5 years.
I have worked here since 2020.
She has worked since the year she joined.
```

**Mẹo:**
- **for** = khoảng thời gian (5 years, 3 months, 2 days)
- **since** = thời điểm bắt đầu (2020, last Monday, 9 AM)

---

### Lỗi 4: Nhầm Past Perfect vs Simple Past

❌ **SAI:**
```
Before he arrived, I finished the work. (Cần nhấn mạn "finished trước" → Past Perfect)
```

✅ **ĐÚNG:**
```
Before he arrived, I had finished the work.
By the time he arrived, I had already finished.
```

---

### Lỗi 5: Sai động từ bất quy tắc

❌ **SAI:**
```
She haved finished the project. (Sai "haved")
They goed to the meeting. (Sai "goed" - phải là "went")
I have writed the report. (Sai "writed" - phải là "written")
```

✅ **ĐÚNG:**
```
She has finished the project.
They went to the meeting.
I have written the report.
```
