## 🔍 2. Grammar Focus: Present Continuous vs Present Simple

### Present Continuous (Hiện tại tiếp diễn) - Dùng trong Part 1
**Cấu trúc:** Subject + am/is/are + V-ing

**Dùng để mô tả:**
- Hành động đang diễn ra tại thời điểm nói
- Những gì nhìn thấy trong hình ảnh Part 1

**Ví dụ:**
```
✅ She is typing on her computer. (Cô ấy đang đánh máy)
✅ They are walking across the bridge. (Họ đang đi qua cầu)
✅ The man is reading a newspaper. (Người đàn ông đang đọc báo)
```

### Present Simple (Hiện tại đơn) - Ít dùng trong Part 1
**Cấu trúc:** Subject + V(s/es)

**Dùng để mô tả:**
- Thói quen, sự thật hiển nhiên
- Trạng thái không thay đổi

**Ví dụ:**
```
✅ The sign says "EXIT." (Biển báo ghi "THOÁT")
✅ This building has five floors. (Tòa nhà này có 5 tầng)
```

## 🎯 6. TOEIC Part 1 Action Tips

### DO:
✅ **Use Present Continuous** - Almost all Part 1 descriptions use "is/are + -ing"
✅ **Be specific about the action** - "typing" not just "using computer"
✅ **Notice the object of action** - what someone is holding, using, or interacting with
✅ **Consider the setting** - office actions, outdoor activities, etc.

### DON'T:
❌ **Describe past or future** - Only what's happening right now
❌ **Guess emotions or intentions** - "He looks happy" is not a good Part 1 answer
❌ **Use complex actions** - Simple, observable actions only
❌ **Ignore prepositions** - "walking to" vs "walking from" matters
