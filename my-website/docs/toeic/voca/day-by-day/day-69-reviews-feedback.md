Read these product reviews and answer questions:

```
📱 SMARTPHONE REVIEWS - TechnoPhone X1

REVIEW 1 - Sarah M. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
"Amazing camera quality! I'm a semi-professional photographer and this phone's camera rivals my DSLR for everyday shots. The night mode is particularly impressive. Battery life easily lasts all day with heavy usage. The price point is reasonable for the features offered. Only minor complaint is that it's slightly heavier than my previous phone, but the build quality justifies the weight. Highly recommended for photography enthusiasts!"

REVIEW 2 - Mike T. ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆
"Solid phone overall. The performance is smooth for gaming and multitasking. Screen quality is crisp and colors are vibrant. However, I've experienced occasional software glitches that require restarting the device. Customer support was responsive when I contacted them about these issues. The phone is good value for money, but there's definitely room for software improvements."

REVIEW 3 - Lisa K. ⭐⭐☆☆☆
"Disappointed with this purchase. The phone frequently overheats during video calls, and the advertised 12-hour battery life only lasts about 6 hours with normal use. The camera is decent but not as revolutionary as the marketing claims. For this price range, I expected much better performance. The design is attractive, but functionality issues make this hard to recommend."

REVIEW 4 - James P. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
"Exceptional device! Upgraded from a 3-year-old phone and the difference is remarkable. Lightning-fast processing, stunning display, and the wireless charging feature is incredibly convenient. The facial recognition works perfectly even in low light. Worth every penny and more. This will definitely be my brand of choice going forward."
