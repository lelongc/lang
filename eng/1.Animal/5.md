Do you ever hear coyotes howling at night?
Occasionally, if I'm out late or the window is open. It sounds quite wild.
It's a reminder that we still have wildlife near the city.

I saw a hawk circling high above, looking for prey.
They have incredible eyesight to spot small animals from that distance.
Nature's hunters are so efficient.

In Chinese mythology, the dragon is a symbol of power and good fortune.
Yes, very different from how dragons are often portrayed in Western stories.
It shows how animals can have different meanings across cultures.

Giraffes have such incredibly long necks.
They're amazing adaptations for reaching leaves high up in trees.
And their spots are all unique, like fingerprints.

We have a family of raccoons that visits our trash cans regularly.
Oh, those masked bandits! They can be quite a nuisance.
It's hard to keep them out, they're very clever.

Is leather still widely used for shoes and bags?
Yes, it's a durable material, although there are many synthetic alternatives now.
Some people prefer real leather, others choose vegan options for ethical reasons.

There's a local project trying to protect a specific type of butterfly habitat.
That's great! Saving even small creatures is important for the ecosystem.
Every species plays a role.

Learning about animals is often a big part of elementary school science.
Kids are usually fascinated by animals, so it's a good way to engage them.
Zoos and nature centers play a role in that education too.

My dog sometimes 'talks' by making these little grumbles and mews.
Haha, it sounds like he's trying to have a conversation with you!
It's funny how expressive animals can be in their own ways.

He's like a fish out of water in this formal setting.
Yeah, he's usually so energetic and outgoing, but here he seems uncomfortable and awkward.
