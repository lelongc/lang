## Scenario 1: Talking About Your Favorite Animal

#### Variation 1 – Informal chat with a friend 

```text
Hey, what’s your favorite animal?  

I’d say elephants. They’re so intelligent and have amazing memories.  
True! Have you ever seen one up close?  
Not in the wild, but I went to a wildlife sanctuary last year—unforgettable.  
```

#### Variation 2 – Small‑talk with a colleague  
```text
Colleague: I heard you love animals. Which one tops your list?  
You: Elephants, for sure. Their social bonds really fascinate me.  
Colleague: Same here. I read they mourn their dead.  
You: Yes, it shows how complex their behavior is.  
```

#### Variation 3 – Online forum introduction  
```text
Moderator: Please introduce yourself and share your favorite animal.  
You: Hi everyone, I’m Alex from the DevOps team. My favorite animal is the elephant because of its intelligence, empathy, and strong family ties.  
Moderator: Great pick!  
You: Thanks—I’m looking forward to learning about yours.

```

#### Variation 2 – Formal team presentation

```text
You: Last month, I joined a group safari in Kenya. We observed a cheetah hunt—rare and insightful for my wildlife‑based UX project analogy: speed and precision.

```

#### Variation 3 – Interview at a conference Q&A

Interviewer: How did that shape your leadership style?
You: It reinforced that clear communication and solidarity drive success under pressure.

**Next Steps:**

- **Drill each mini‑dialogue** until you can switch roles on the fly.
- **Swap formality:** expand/informalize phrases to fit manager vs. friend.
- **Record & shadow** native speakers on similar topics for intonation.

By practicing these **15 dialogues**, you’ll internalize structures and key vocab—for “Animal” and beyond. Happy practicing!
