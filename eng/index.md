As a rough guideline, to really internalize one “topic” you’ll want to cover it from several angles—ideally:

[ielts](./ielts.md)
[business](./business.md)

- **5–7 core scenarios**  
  Think of 5–7 distinct situations or “use cases” for that topic.

  - e.g. for **“Progress Tracking”** you might role‑play:
    1. One‑on‑one status update with your manager
    2. Daily stand‑up in a Scrum team
    3. Escalating a delay to a client
    4. Sending a written status report by email
    5. Presenting a road‑block in a retrospective

- **2–3 dialogue variations per scenario**  
  Once you’ve outlined those core contexts, write/learn 2–3 slightly different versions of each:
  - varying formality (more casual vs. more formal)
  - different interlocutors (peer vs. manager vs. client)
  - different problem‑levels (routine update vs. urgent issue)

That gives you:

```
5 scenarios × 3 variations = 15 mini‑dialogues
7 scenarios × 2 variations = 14 mini‑dialogues
```

In other words, **around 12–20 dialogues per topic**.

### How to Practice

1. **Learn the “skeleton”**
   - Jot down the key exchange points (e.g. greeting, state status, ask for feedback, close).
2. **Populate with vocabulary & phrases**
   - Pick 5–8 bullets of essential vocab/phrasal‑verbs for that topic.
3. **Role‑play (or record yourself)**
   - Run through each variation, swapping roles if possible.
4. **Shadow & tweak**
   - Listen to a native‑speaker sample (podcast, YouTube clip) on a similar scenario and mimic rhythm/intonation.
5. **Feedback loop**
   - Note which phrases felt awkward and replace/refine them over time.

By the time you’ve done **15–20 two‑speaker exchanges** on a single topic—each one practiced until you can switch seamlessly between both sides—you’ll have internalized the flow and vocabulary well enough to handle that topic confidently in real life.

To really internalize a single topic so you can speak confidently about it, you’ll want a mix of **core nouns**, **verbs**, **adjectives**, and **set phrases/collocations**. A good ballpark is:

- **15–20 core nouns** (e.g. for “Animal”: elephant, predator, habitat…)  
- **10–15 key verbs** (e.g. graze, migrate, poach, thrive…)  
- **5–10 useful adjectives** (e.g. endangered, majestic, elusive…)  
- **5–8 phrasal verbs/idioms** (e.g. “look after,” “run wild,” “in the wild,” “a fish out of water”)  

Altogether that’s **35–50 items** per topic. Why this range?

1. **Depth vs. breadth:**  
   – 15–20 nouns cover the “things” you talk about.  
   – 10–15 verbs let you describe actions and processes.  
   – 5–10 adjectives help you add color and precision.  
2. **Fluency in context:**  
   – Phrasal verbs and idioms are how native speakers naturally talk.  
   – Learning collocations (e.g. “wildlife conservation,” “endangered species”) trains your ear for authentic usage.  
3. **Retention & automaticity:**  
   – 35–50 items is enough to cycle through spaced‑repetition without overload.  
   – It gives you enough variety to handle 5–7 mini‑dialogues per topic (as we outlined), without feeling repetitive.

Of course, if you find certain topics richer or more technical (like “Finance” or “Cybersecurity”), you might push toward the **50–60** range by adding more specialized terms. For light, everyday topics (like “Weather” or “Food”), **30–35** well‑chosen words and phrases will usually suffice.

**Tip:** Group your vocab into semantic clusters (e.g. for “Animal”: “habitat” words, “behavior” verbs, “conservation” nouns) and practice them in short dialogues or flashcards. That way each new word reinforces several related ones—and you’ll hit mastery faster.
