**Pro Tip:** For each topic, structure your dialogue practice in three parts:  
1. **Introduction** – frame the issue or context.  
2. **Body** – dive into details, suggestions, or solutions.  
3. **Conclusion/Next Steps** – summarize and propose actions.  

Use openers like “What do you think about…?”, “How would you handle…?”, and responses such as “In my experience…,” “I’d suggest that we…,” or “One possible solution is….” Practice with flashcards for key vocabulary and role‑plays to solidify these skills across any industry.
